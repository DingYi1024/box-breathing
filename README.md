# [Box Breathing Technique: A visual animation to help with calmness, mindfulness, stress and anxiety](https://github.com/DingYi1024/box-breathing)

This box breathing animation (not a gif or simple diagram) visually guides you in this useful exercise. It is also known as square breathing or diaphragmatic breathing. It has numerous benefits such as reduced anxiety, stress and increased mindfulness, calmness and relaxation.

I made this site as a CSS exercise after seeing [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33586383) on HackerNews.
